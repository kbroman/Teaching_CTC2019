This is a short tutorial on QTL analysis in the BXD mouse recombinant
inbred lines using [R/qtl2](https://kbroman.org/qtl2), to be presented
at the [Complex Trait Community meeting](http://ratgenes.org/ctc2019/)
in San Diego on 9 June 2019.

The goal is to demonstrate

- grabbing BXD phenotype data via the
[GeneNetwork2](http://gn2.genenetwork.org) API, using the
[R/GNapi](https://github.com/rqtl/GNapi) package

- QTL mapping with [R/qtl2](https://kbroman.org/qtl2)

- browsing QTL results using the [Genetics Genome
  Browser](https://github.com/chfi/purescript-genome-browser) and the
  [R/qtl2browse](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2browse) package

It's presented both as a [Jupyter notebook](CTC2019_tutorial.ipynb)
and as [R Markdown](CTC2019_tutorial.Rmd). The compiled R Markdown
file is at
<https://kbroman.org/Teaching_CTC2019/CTC2019_tutorial.html>.

Live versions of the Jupyter notebook, or of RStudio with appropriate
packages installed, are available via the above
[binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/) badges.
